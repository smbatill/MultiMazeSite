<h1> Would you like to Build and Sove Some Interesting Mazes? </h1>

<p> When you click on the mazes shown below a new window will open. In that window will be a maze and a Control Panel. Depending upon the device you are using and the type of maze there are different ways to trace a path through the maze from the entrance to the exit. You can also download and print the maze to solve using the old-fashioned "pencil" approach. Then you can make as many new mazes, as complex as you desire. </p>

<h1> How to Build and Solve new Mazes? </h1>

<p> To SAVE: Click on the [SAVE] button and a jpeg file will downloaded to your device.

<p> To SOLVE: Click on the [SOLVE] button a "dot" will appear near the entrance arrow of the maze. You can move the dot through the maze to get to the exit arrow. You will leave a trail of "dots"
    as you move through the maze.
</p>

<p> To Build a NEW maze: Click on the grey slider and move the black slider bar to change the maze complexity. Then Click on the [NEW] button and a new maze will appear! 
</p>

<p> There are different ways to trace your path through the maze depending upon the maze type and device you are using. 
<br>
Blue Buttons using mouse, touchpad or screen touch.
<br>
Keyboard arrow keys
<br>
Keyboard key indicated (*) on the Blue Buttons
<br>

<p>
One final word of caution. The slidebar that is used to change the maze complexity does not function smoothly when using a touch screen on a  smartphone or tablet. It is a bit wonky but still works. Try "touching" the grey bar at the complexity level you want, hold the touch for about 1 sec and release. The black square should move to your touch and when you touch [NEW MAZE] the new maze at that new complexity level should appear. Try and see what works best for you and we'll keep trying to sort this out!

       Note: The buttons indicate CW-clockwise or CCW-counterclockwise and In - toward the center or 
       Out - away from the center. Since the rings get more complicated as you move out
       from the center, you sometimes need to move out in either a CW or CCW direction.

   <p> Click on the Maze below to Build, Solve or Print an OCTAGON Maze!

   <br> 
       The OCTAGON Mazes have two [SOLVE] modes. With the EASY mode you can "jump" the small
       horizontal or vertical walls to move to an adjecent cell if the walls in the small square
       cell between the octagon cell is missing. In the HARD mode you can only move in
       straight lines between the center of the octagon cells (no wall jumping!). 
       It does make for an interesting challenge. Try both!</>

<p> This website has evolved from a series of coding projects by a retired teacher for a grandson who likes mazes. Each maze type has evolved from the original "square" maze concept and each maze that is generated is unique. The mazes are free and hope they make some other grandchildren happy. If you enjoy this site, share it with a friend.

    Cheers, the MazeBuilder
